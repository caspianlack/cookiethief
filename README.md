# Cookie Thief

## Neesa is a girl who really loves cookies from The Cookie Jar, a local bakery. One day, she decides to steal not just cookies from the bakery, but their secret recipe also.
However, she doesn't realize that the bakery is guarded by a group of robots chefs, and she must use her wit and agility to escape with the recipe.

A fast-paced procedural descent platformer inspired by Downwell with explosive side arenas reminiscent of Bomb Jack.
